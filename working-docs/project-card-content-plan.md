# Project Card Content Plan

## Overview

This plan outlines a minimalist yet informative approach for presenting project details in the project-sheet-content component. The design will maintain consistency across all projects while highlighting key information that would appeal to both product designers and engineering hiring managers.

## Project Structure

Each project card will follow this structure:

1. **Header Section**

   - Full-width video showcase (existing)
   - Project title (existing)
   - Company and year (existing)

2. **Project Summary**

   - Brief one-paragraph description (3-4 sentences maximum)
   - Focuses on problem solved, solution provided, and impact

3. **Technical Details**

   - Tech stack used (displayed as compact badges)
   - Key features implemented (3-5 bullet points)

4. **Metrics & Impact**

   - 2-4 key metrics showing project success
   - Visual representation using minimal stats cards

5. **Role & Contributions**
   - Brief description of specific responsibilities
   - Focus on design process or engineering challenges based on the project

## Design Implementation

- Use existing design system (Tailwind + custom components)
- Maintain consistent spacing, typography, and color scheme
- Implement responsive design for all content sections
- Use subtle animations only where they enhance understanding
- Ensure accessibility with proper contrast and semantic HTML

## Content Principles

1. **Concise:** No paragraph longer than 3-4 sentences
2. **Specific:** Focus on concrete achievements, not general responsibilities
3. **Quantifiable:** Include metrics where possible
4. **Technical:** Include enough technical detail to demonstrate expertise
5. **Balanced:** Appeal to both design and engineering perspectives

This plan provides a cohesive framework while highlighting the unique aspects of each project, ensuring a succinct yet comprehensive portfolio presentation.
