ZCN FUN SUMMARIZED

Pickaxe work:

Project 2
ZCN.fun

The first Pickaxe project is called zcn.fun. This site was created to solve a problem for a crypto platform called Zus, which introduces a concept of “centralized data storage.” In essence, it works similarly to Bitcoin mining, where miners run algorithms to earn Bitcoin by contributing computational power to the network. However, on the Zus platform, you can provide cloud storage to earn its native crypto token, ZCN.
Users have two main ways to earn money on Zus:

1. Run a server (Blobber): Set up and operate a cloud server known as a “Blobber.”
2. Stake ZCN: Allocate (“stake”) your tokens on an existing Blobber to effectively sponsor it. In return, you earn a portion of that Blobber’s revenue, since your staked tokens help support its operations.
   The key problem was the lack of any tool to track what are called PPRs (the staking yields) or to determine how profitable a particular Blobber could be. There was also no simple way to find the most profitable or trustworthy Blobbers.
   To address this, zcn.fun was created by PickX (by me). I used BigQuery and Firebase to aggregate data on all Blobbers, track their rewards, and calculate yields so that users could see their potential APRs. I then used Nevo Charts to visualize these metrics. The project received approximately $20,000 in funding and was very well-received by the community. Many users relied on zcn.fun to reposition their stakes and identify the most profitable opportunities.
