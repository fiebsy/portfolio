Below are **five** creative (yet minimalist) timeline concepts. Each represents four key dimensions:

1. **Timeline** itself (chronology from 2020 to 2025).  
2. **Role** (Product Designer vs. Engineer).  
3. **Company** (Zeus, Pickaxe, WAP).  
4. **Specific product launches**.

Each concept includes:  
- A brief **description** of how it works and why it might be appealing to a hiring manager.  
- A **text-based mockup** giving you an idea of how the final design might look in a simple ASCII style.

Feel free to adapt the labeling or spacing. The core idea is to give you a starting structure that you can later translate into a more polished web or graphical design.

## 1) Minimalist Two-Row Gantt with Markers

### Concept Description
- **Row 1** focuses on **roles** (Designer vs. Engineer) as color/pattern-coded bars.  
- **Row 2** focuses on **companies** (Zeus, Pickaxe, WAP) along the same timeline, also color/pattern-coded.  
- **Product launches** appear as small markers (like `*`) on the second row.  
- This clean, two-level structure makes it easy to see your overall roles (top) plus company/project milestones (bottom).

### Mockup (ASCII Approximation)

```
Timeline: 2020       2021       2022       2023       2024       2025
          |----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|
Role:     [Designer (Zeus)]----- [Designer→Engineer (Pickaxe)]--------------
          ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
          (pattern ^ = Designer)   (pattern * = Engineer)

Company:  [Zeus]------------------ [Pickaxe]---------------- [WAP]---       
          |-------|               |-------------|           |-----|
          |-------|               *ZCN.fun (Sep'24)
                                  *Binox (Aug'24)
                                                      *WAP Proj1 (Feb'25)
                                                      *WAP Proj2 (Apr'25)
```

- **`[ ]`** blocks or **`------`** lines indicate durations (colored or pattern-filled in an actual design).  
- **`*XYZ (Month'YY)`** indicates product launches.  
- You could color “Designer” in one pattern (like a cross-hatch) and “Engineer” in another.  
- Companies get their own color to avoid confusion.

---

## 2) Vertical Milestone Ladder

### Concept Description
- A vertical line from top (oldest) to bottom (most recent).  
- **Left side**: Markers for the **roles** over time.  
- **Right side**: Boxes/bubbles representing **company** stints. Each bubble contains its product launches as sub-bullets.  
- Clean and straightforward if you want a “reading down” approach.

### Mockup (ASCII Approximation)

```
2020  |  ──(Role) Designer at Zeus─────────
      |          
2021  |          
      |    
2022  |  ──(Role) Designer at Pickaxe───────
      |               ┌─(Company) Zeus (ended)
      |               └─(Company) Pickaxe (started)
2023  |  ──(Role) Designer→Engineer─────────
      |  
2024  |               (Pickaxe) 
      |                 • Binox launched (Aug)
      |                 • ZCN.fun launched (Sep)
2025  |  ──(Role) Engineer continued────────
      |               (WAP)
      |                 • Project A (Feb)
      |                 • Project B (Apr)
      |
      ▼ (Present)
```

- Role transitions are noted at each year marker on the left.  
- Company expansions or changes are on the right, with product bullets beneath each company timeline.  
- This is highly scannable and intuitive to read from top to bottom.

## 3) Layered Horizontal Bands with Project Flags

### Concept Description
- Imagine **parallel horizontal bands**: one for **role** (with sub-layers for Designer vs. Engineer), one for **company** (Zeus → Pickaxe → WAP).  
- **Flags** (or small triangles) along these bands mark the **product launches**.  
- The idea is to keep everything in a single horizontal orientation but separate them vertically.

### Mockup (ASCII Approximation)

```
   2020      2021      2022      2023      2024      2025
    |---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
Role: 
    Designer: ####### (Zeus) ########## (Pickaxe)     
    Engineer:                    ---------------(Pickaxe)---------(WAP)

Companies: 
    Zeus:      ######     
    Pickaxe:              ############################
    WAP:                                             #####

Products: 
          (Zeus)    (Pickaxe)        (Pickaxe)       (WAP)
                    ^Binox (Aug'24)  ^ZCN.fun (Sep'24) ^Proj1(Feb'25)
                                                      ^Proj2(Apr'25)
```

- **`#`** patterns could be color-coded differently for roles and companies.  
- **`^`** above the timeline indicates product releases.  
- Ensures that at first glance you see two big stripes (role & company) plus small flags.

## 4) Minimal “Swimlane” Timeline with Overlapping Roles

### Concept Description
- **Swimlanes** are like horizontal rows, each row a dimension: (1) Designer role, (2) Engineer role, (3) Companies.  
- If you want to explicitly show that the Engineer role **overlaps** or “sits on top of” the Designer skillset, you can place the Engineer row above it but with partial overlap.  
- Product releases can be small pinned items or icons on the company row.

### Mockup (ASCII Approximation)

```
            2020 - 2021 - 2022 - 2023 - 2024 - 2025
Engineer:               ---------------------------
Designer:  --------------------------- (continues) ------------
          
Company: Zeus:   2020----2022 
         Pickaxe:           2022----------------------Present
         WAP:                                       2025------

Releases (on Company lane):
         Zeus:   None
         Pickaxe:         Binox (Aug'24)
                          ZCN.fun (Sep'24)
         WAP:                                    Proj1 (Feb'25)
                                                Proj2 (Apr'25)
```

- This visually highlights “Engineer” beginning while “Designer” still continues in some capacity (since design is a skillset you keep).  
- Products pinned directly in the row for each company.

---

## 5) Zig-Zag Fold Timeline

### Concept Description
- A **zig-zag or stepped** timeline that alternates sides for each new entry—useful if you want a more creative or visually distinctive layout without extra clutter.  
- One side (left) shows **role** milestones, the other side (right) shows **company** + product releases. Each step in the zig-zag is anchored by a year or date range.

### Mockup (ASCII Approximation)

```
         ┌───────────────────────┐
2020-22  │ (Role) Designer @Zeus │  <-- Step on Left
         └───────────────────────┘
                     |
                     |    ┌────────────────────────────────┐
2022-23              |----│ (Role) Designer @Pickaxe       │  <-- Step on Right
                     |    └────────────────────────────────┘
                     |
         ┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
2023-24  │ (Role) Engineer @Pickaxe           │  <-- Step on Left
         └─────────────────────────────────────┘
                     |
                     |    ┌───────────────────────────────────────────┐
2024      (Products)    │ - Binox (Aug'24)                            │
                        │ - ZCN.fun (Sep'24)                          │  <-- Step on Right
                     |    └───────────────────────────────────────────┘
                     |
         ┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
2025     │ (Role) Engineer @WAP               │  <-- Step on Left
         └─────────────────────────────────────┘
               (Products: Proj1 - Feb'25, Proj2 - Apr'25)
```

- The **zig-zag** pattern keeps it visually engaging but still straightforward.  
- You can highlight each date range (2020–22, 2022–23, etc.), roles, companies, and product releases in minimal boxes.

## Why These Work for Hiring Managers

1. **Immediate Clarity**: Each variation focuses on conveying the roles (Designer vs. Engineer) alongside companies and product launches in a way that a recruiter or hiring manager can quickly parse.  
2. **Minimalist**: None of these rely on heavy ornamentation; they’re mostly about clear structure, spacing, and a small set of symbols.  
3. **Creative Twist**: Zig-zag steps, layered bands, or vertical ladders add just enough design appeal to stand out without overcomplicating the data.

---

### Next Steps

- Choose the structure you like best.  
- Replace ASCII with color blocks or subtle patterns (e.g., in React + Tailwind, you might have distinct background colors, icons, etc.).  
- Align date labels precisely for a polished look.  
- Consider interactive hovers or clickable markers for more detail if you’re building this in a web portfolio.

Whichever you pick, these designs should help demonstrate both your **design** sensibility and **front-end** data visualization skills at a glance!
